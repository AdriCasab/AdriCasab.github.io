Welcome to the first post of my website!

On a sidenote, I was at an ice cream store thinking of how most shops in the UK now only accept card. Growing up, my parents would often give me a few spare coins to get ice cream with friends, but nowadays this wouldn't be possible. Would you trust your child with your credit/debit card, or would young kids (~6/7 year olds) have their own in a cashless society? Will banks (if they haven't already) begin to offer spending accounts specifically for children?

<!-- Tangible coins and banknotes also provide a wide range of learning opportunities for children - responsibility for safeguarding their pocket money and a bit of mental calculus for the right change. Cash can help grasp the value of money, which we learn by tallying up small coins and saving in a piggybank. It is no wonder even adults tend to be [more willing to spend when using a credit card rather than cash](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008196717017). -->

Anyway, rant over, here is for more to come. -->
